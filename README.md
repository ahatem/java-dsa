# java-dsa

This is my personal public repository for practicing data structures, algorithms, and LeetCode solutions in Java. It’s a coding lab for experimenting with core computer science concepts and improving my problem-solving skills.

## Purpose

This repository is for my personal practice, focusing on:
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, and hash tables.
- **Algorithms**: Searching (e.g., binary search), sorting (e.g., quicksort, mergesort), and other algorithmic techniques.
- **LeetCode Solutions**: Solutions to LeetCode problems to hone problem-solving skills.

The code is written for learning and experimentation, shared publicly for reference or potential collaboration.

## Notes
- This is a work-in-progress project. New data structures, algorithms, and LeetCode solutions will be added over time.
- LeetCode solutions may include comments when I’m able to provide explanations.
- The code focuses on learning and experimentation, often aiming for clarity but sometimes exploring optimized solutions.
- Testing can be done via `Main.java`
